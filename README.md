## Features

### Dimension-Specific Color Coding

The colors used to represent the light levels can be customized in `config/light-level-2025.yaml` as
hex color codes.

#### Overworld

- **Hostile mobs cannot spawn**
    - color: green
    - conditions:
        - block light >= 1
    - config field: `text.color.safe`

- **Hostile mobs can spawn at night**
    - color: yellow
    - conditions:
        - block light = 0
        - sky light >= 8
    - config field: `text.color.warning`

- **Hostile mobs can always potentially spawn**
    - color: red
    - conditions:
        - block light = 0
        - sky light <= 7
    - config field: `text.color.danger`

#### The Nether

- **Mobs cannot spawn**
    - color: green
    - conditions:
        - block light >= 12
    - config field: `text.color.safe`

- **Mobs can always potentially spawn**
    - color: red
    - conditions:
        - block light <= 11
    - config field: `text.color.danger`

#### The End

- **Mobs cannot spawn**
    - color: green
    - conditions:
        - block light >= 1
    - config field: `text.color.safe`

- **Mobs can always potentially spawn**
    - color: red
    - conditions:
        - block light = 0
    - config field: `text.color.danger`

### Adjustable Text Height

If a block that doesn't have a collision box is above the target block and its appearance
obstructs the text, the light
level will be shown above its visual.

### Debug Mode

Press **F3** to show both the block light and the sky light levels.

## Technical Features

### Block Exclusion Conditions

The rendering on a target block will be skipped if:

- The target block is one of the following (config field: `block.blacklist`):
    - `minecraft:air`
    - `minecraft:barrier`
    - `minecraft:bedrock`
    - `minecraft:chain_command_block`
    - `minecraft:command_block`
    - `minecraft:end_portal`
    - `minecraft:nether_portal`
    - `minecraft:repeating_command_block`

- The target block is not opaque and visually transparent.
    - Examples Excluded:
        - `minecraft:glass`
        - `minecraft:ice`
    - Examples Not Excluded:
        - `minecraft:glowstone`
        - `minecraft:packed_ice`

- The target block does not have a full square top surface.
    - Examples Excluded:
        - bottom slabs
        - right-side-up stairs
    - Examples Not Excluded:
        - top slabs
        - up-side-down stairs

- A block above the target block has a collision shape.
    - Examples Excluded:
        - `minecraft:ladder`
        - `minecraft:snow` (layers count >= 2)
    - Examples Not Excluded:
        - `minecraft:vine`
        - `minecraft:snow` (layers count = 1)

### Caching

This mod caches information about block positions and the text to be rendered, storing it in memory
for faster access.

By setting the cache update frequency in frames, the update rate automatically adjusts based on
FPS â€” updating more frequently in high-FPS environments and less frequently in low-FPS environments.

You can change the update frequency via `cache.update_interval_frames` in the config file.

### Rendering Culling

This mod does not render the light level for a target block that is invisible to the player.
